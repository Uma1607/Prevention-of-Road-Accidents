## Overview
The Drowsiness Detector is a deep learning-based system designed to enhance driver safety by detecting drowsiness and fatigue. The system leverages a combination of advanced techniques to monitor drivers' facial states and issue timely alerts. The accuracy of the system has significantly improved from 76% to 91% through rigorous testing and model enhancements.

## Features
1. Eye State Recognition: Identifies and classifies eye states into Sleepy, Drowsy, and Active categories.
2. Yawn Detection: Detects yawning to further assess driver alertness.
3. Automatic Alarm System: Triggers an alarm to alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
4. Live Facial State Monitoring: Utilizes a webcam or external device to capture real-time facial parameters and apply them to the deep learning model.

## How It Works
1. Data Capture: The system captures live images of the driver's face using a webcam or external device.
2. Image Analysis: The captured images are processed by the deep learning model, which excels at analyzing facial features and states.
3. Detection: The model classifies the driver's eye state and detects yawns.
4. Alert Generation: If drowsiness or fatigue is detected, the system triggers an automatic alarm to alert the driver.

## Performance
1. The accuracy of the drowsiness detection system has improved from 76% to 91%, demonstrating significant advancements in model performance and reliability.
