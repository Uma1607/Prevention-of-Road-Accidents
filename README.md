# Prevention-of-Road-Accidents
To prevent drivers from risk of accidents, I have implemented a Drowsiness Detector using Deep Learning which alerts the drivers in the least possible time. Compared to existing features in our system we have combined the eye state recognition (Sleepy/Drowsy/Active), Yawn detection and Automatic Alarm system to alert the driver. Assuming various conditions and situations the device will live capture drivers facial state parameters using Web Cam or external device and apply it to the Developed Deep Learning Model as they are excellent at analyzing images with high level of semantics and produces live results.
